## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I'm interested to explore the effectiveness of Full Lockdown in controlling the spread of Covid 19:

1. What are the major actions taken by different Country in the world in dealing with Covid-19?
2. Which country implemented Full Lockdown and which does not?
3. Why Italy and Spain have high accumulated confirmed cases even with Full Lockdown?
4. Is Full Lockdown help in flattening the curve from the spike of Covid?
5. How about countries that do not implement Full Lockdown?
